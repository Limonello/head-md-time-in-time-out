# What Chronosto it is ?

Chronostos are personal time markers used in our daily life to perceive time. Based on our past experiences, a Chronosto also uses our five senses.

I imagined a type of clock using Chronostos to build a personalized  timeline for everyone. It can take appointments with other people, but, instead of an hour, the clock gives a different Chronostos to everyone. They have to reunite with different indications. Close people can exchange Chronostos to have the same marker when they set an appointment.
