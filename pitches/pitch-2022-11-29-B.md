# It's a Broth Smell and a few minutes before the comet

You’re a passionate yet not very talented scientist. Your boss gave you one last chance to avoid firing you. You have to watch over the lab’s telescope. The one that’s gonna photograph an incoming comet when it’s the closest to the Earth. Everything is automatic so it’s an easy task. 
But on the very day, the comet stops all the clocks on Earth. Without time, the telescope can’t work. And on top of that, you're all by yourself because all your collegues are at a convention on the other side of the country.

To save your career, you’ll have to observe your environment to find clues about what time it is. This way, you'll be able to enter it manually in the telescope and make it work again. The objective: take a picture of the comet.
