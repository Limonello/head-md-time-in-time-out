# I forgot the smell of pepper, we are no longer in summer

I asked 6 people (including me) to list every time they use one of their five senses to estimate what time it is, from last Friday to Monday. I discovered that the « time references » really depend of the context and of what happened previously. This way of perceiving time is also used for different time scales (hours, days, …).

So I imagined a world where everyone has a personalized clock only built from their references. It will adapt trough time and context and would be the only clock available.
