# I forgot the smell of pepper, we are no longer in summer

A lot of people have different markers, other than clocks or calendars, based on their daily life (sound, smell, â€¦) to perceive time.

I imagined a world where everyone has a personalized clock only built from their own time markers. It will adapt through time and context and would be the only type of clock available. This clock goes against the concept of collective time introduced to optimized the productivity. Can we still manage collective time with very personal and abstract time devices ?
