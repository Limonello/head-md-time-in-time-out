# How do you percieve time ? - Testimonies

"I percieve time as every moment I wait before the next one. I'm cooking right now and this is a good example. Now, I'm waiting for the stock to reduce. That's my unit of time. Then, I'll be waiting for the meat to be cooked. And then that the udon (noodles) are ready. An indivisible unit. An atom of time. It's no use to cut it in half. I see time as the anticipation of a moment to come."

"When I think of time, I imagine things that are constantly evolving and moving. (As in, the rain finally stopping, my hair falling down because I’m low on iron again, a new building is under construction..) And how I base I am aware of time passing on a day to day basis is especially thanks to the light. When I notice that shadows move and the light intensity changes, I know that time is going by. When there is no natural light, for me time freezes. For example, during a winter evening I might be working for hours, but to me it seems like it’s only been 20 minutes; or when I’m at a bar partying, everything else stops, and then I go outside and I’m shocked to see the first glimpses of sunrise.
And then there’s the classic saying that « time goes by faster when you’re having fun » which I think is true because you are immersed in « the zone » and don’t notice the changes in the environment.
For me calendars and plannera are necessary, otherwise I can loose track of the days and months."

"It's complicated for me since I'm hyperactive. If I'm doing nothing, I have the impresssion that time has stopped. If I'm doing something that I'm interessed in, I don't pay attention and I can stay for hours on my seat without moving. For me, time is like a wheel. If I do nothing, it doesn't move. If I'm active, it starts rolling."

"It depends if I'm absorbed by something or not. If I'm bored, my brain can't hold onto something and time goes pretty slowly. But if I'm doing something that interess me and that litteraly absorbs my notion of time, everything goes pretty/too much quickly. To me, time is like moutains. Sometime, it's hard to cross and to climb and sometime, in descent, it's very enjoyable but always too short."

"It doesn't matter how much time pass, the truth always comes out."
