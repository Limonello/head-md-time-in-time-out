Try to make more clear the relation between the camera and the investigation part. People struggled to understand it. Since the prototype was made from paper, it was more complicate to have the "trying to put this there and see what happens" for the puzzle parts and the camera. A part thing that actually worked for the other elements (the relation between the story, the places and the objects).

People also had a hard time to understand the logic "I have to fix the internal clock of the camera in order to make it functional again". Also, they focus on finding the exact hour instead of the broader idea of time built by observing our environement (logic > symbolic).

People tend to create a chornology between the stories and the places (may be a problem or not, it really depend on how they then use the puzzle pieces).

It's note very clear for the people what should be left once the mini-story is resolved. The clue may be to close from the other objects. Also, there is a confusion about what is the clue ("Are they the pieces that are listed in the story or the other one ?"). But this may not be a problem with if you can try the pieces on the camera and see if there is a reaction or not.

Maybe better resultas if the game is played by one person. With more people trying to resolve it toghether, they tend to go in to much different directions at the same time.
